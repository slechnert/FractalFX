# Fractal Visualizer


#### As a user I want to be able to....

+ ...see a visualization of a fractal (Mandelbrot)
+ ...adjust the color scheme of the visualization to make it more beautiful
+ ...pick his own combination of colors for the visualization to make it more customizable while (probably) becoming more beautiful
+ ...initially adjust the zoom level of the shown graphic* to test and play
+ ...easily register and log in to the app to have a personal profile
+ ...save his combinations as custom color schemes**
+ ...switch between fractals (e.g. Julia, Apollonian gasket,...)
+ ...see a history of used zoom / color / fractal combinations
+ ...choose from different computation methods to compare how they perform

------

### Milestones

#### I can...

***1)***    **Day 3:** ...start the application and it shows a Mandelbrot visualization  *(Java / JavaFX)*

***2)***	**Day 4:** ...pick different color schemes or create my own

***3)***	**Day 5:** ...freely input zoom values

***4)***	**Day 6:** ...click through registration/log in *functionality level: Dummie*
	
***5)***	**Day 7:** ...actually register myself and log in *(MySQL, JDBC)*

***6)***	**Day 8:** ...save my own color / zoom picks as custom schemes

***7)***	**Day 9:** ...choose from multiple fractals

***8)***	**Day 10:** ...give a presentation of the process and result :)
